*Chat App React!

This is an app that allows messages to be added with a username.

This is the front-end of the app which displays all the messages and the form to be able to add a new message.

This app was created using MongoDb, Express, React, Node, Axios and Bulma.

*Usage

Copy the repo URL and type: git clone "Insert URL Here"

Change directory:
  cd chat-react
Initialize Git:
  git init
Install Packages:
  npm install
Start the App!:
  npm start

A browser will open with the view allowing an input to be placed in the text fields to add a comment to the app.

*DISCLAIMER
This app won't work unless you also have the back-end set-up. Clone done the chat-api repository and follow the instructions to complete the application.

Happy Coding!
